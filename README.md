# R_Documentation
## This Repository mainly deals with *Writing* functions in R instead of using them.
These files include progamming in R using three practical projects. They cover the breadth of the R language. 
These tasks are taught to develop data-science skills, which require judgement and expertise not only programming exercises. 
Ive mainly used the book "Hands on Programming with R" for learning. 
The three projects are:
1.  Project 1: Weighted Dice
2.  Project 2: Playing Cards
3.  Project 3: Slot Machine

These projects teach:
- How to load, assemble and disassemble data objects
- navigate R’s environment system
- write your own functions and Use of all R’s programming tools
- The projects teach solving logistical problems of data science
- They also teach writing vectorized R code, a style of lightning-fast code that takes advantage of all of the things R does best.
